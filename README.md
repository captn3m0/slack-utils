#slack-utils [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/captn3m0/slack-utils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/captn3m0/slack-utils)

This is a collection of various slack-api related scripts that I've written. Published as an npm module.

Development is done in coffeescript, but that is not a dependency for usage.
